### Background
PhD student in mathematics who fights to fund his research.

*"The probability matrix I developed during camp predicted this outcome with 73% confidence. He committed to the jab-cross combination 41% of the time when I circled left, which created opportunities for my counter-entries. Fascinating."*

**After Loss**:
*"Interesting. My model didn't account for his southpaw adjustment in round two. I'll need to recalibrate the variables. This is actually excellent data for my research. The loss stings, but the information is valuable."*

**When Asked to Explain His Approach**:
*"Fighting is just physics, leverage, probabilities, and pattern recognition. Most fighters rely on intuition, which is just subconscious pattern matching. I make it conscious. Theory suggests this provides 12-15% efficiency gain."*

**On Trash Talk**:
*"I... I don't understand the purpose of pre-fight verbal exchanges. They don't affect the outcome. Why waste energy? I'd rather study his tendencies."*
